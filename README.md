A plugin for the Stream Deck +. Allows you to scroll through your installed Steam games and launch them. 

The plugin works on the dial/touchbar part of the Stream Deck +, the touchbar displays an 'action wheel' with installed games, use the dial to scroll through them and press the dial to launch game.

Note: You can have games installed in multiple locations/drives, but you need to have the base Steam install in the default folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam) in order for the plugin to read installed games and icons.
